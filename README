NAME
    HTTP::Online - Detect full "Internet" (HTTP) access using Microsoft NCSI

SYNOPSIS
        if ( HTTP::Online->new->online ) {
            print "Confirmed internet connection\n";
        } else {
            print "Internet is not available\n";
            exit(0);
        }
        
    # Now do your task that needs the internet...

DESCRIPTION
    HTTP::Online is a port of the older LWP::Online module to HTTP::Tiny
    that uses only the (most accurate) methodology, <Microsoft NCSI>.

  Test Mode
      use LWP::Online ':skip_all';

    As a convenience when writing tests scripts base on Test::More, the
    special ':skip_all' param can be provided when loading LWP::Online.

    This implements the functional equivalent of the following.

            BEGIN {
                    unless ( HTTP::Online->new->online ) {
                            require Test::More;
                            Test::More->import(
                                    skip_all => 'Test requires a working internet connection'
                            );
                    }
            }

METHODS
  new
            my $internet = HTTP::Online->new;

            my $custom = HTTP::Online->new(
                    http    => $custom_http_client,
                    url     => 'http://my-ncsi-server.com/',
                    content => 'Our Custom NCSI Server',
            );

    The "new" constructor creates a query object.

    By default, it will be configured to use the same Microsoft NCSI service
    that the Windows Network Awareness system does (from Windows Vista
    onwards).

    Returns a HTTP::Online object.

  http
    The "http" method returns the HTTP client that will be used for the
    query.

  url
    The "url" method returns a string with the location URL of the NCSI
    file.

  content
    The "content" method returns a string with the expected string to be
    returned from the NCSI server.

  online
    The "online" method issues a "Pragma: no-cache" request to the server,
    and examines the response to confirm that no redirects have occurred,
    and that the returned content matches the expected value.

    Returns true if full HTTP internet access is available, or false
    otherwise.

  offline
    The "offline" method is a convenience which currently returns the
    opposite of the "online" method, returning false if full HTTP internet
    access is available, or true otherwise.

    This may change in future to only return true if we are completely
    offline, and true in situations where we have partial internet access or
    the user needs to fill out some web form or view advertising to get full
    internet access.
